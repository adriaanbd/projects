## Background

I learned Python in August 2016 to automate a repetitive business task that provided a 95% time savings benefit for my previous employer. The script did full name permutations according to specific language naming conventions for English, Spanish, Portuguese, Thai and Chinese names. I've led and participated in business and technical requirements gathering and analysis, stakeholder meetings, data analysis and visualization, UI mock-ups and workshops.
